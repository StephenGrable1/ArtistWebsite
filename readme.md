A mobile responsive artist website.

Technologies used:
Jade (now referred to as Pug) for HTML templating, Sass for advanced CSS, Javascript including Node (Express) for backend server support/custom build scripts and Velocity.js for interactive animations.

I really learned a lot during this build. I explored ways to modularize my code and also utilized modern techniques to dramatically improve performance. I used npm scripts to compile and minify javascript/css files and to optimize images for the web. I employed a dynamic loading system for video that loads only when the user wants to view the content. These techniques dramatically minimized the initial loading time and without a doubt will enhance the overall experience of the website.

I enjoyed using Jade(Pug) and Sass for this build. These tools made it very easy to split up my code into sections that reflected the content of the site. If I or someone else happens to revisit this code, I have no doubt that it will be easy to understand and contribute to.
